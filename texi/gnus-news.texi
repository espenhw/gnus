@itemize @bullet

@item Upgrading from previous (stable) version if you have used No Gnus.

If you have tried No Gnus (the unstable Gnus branch leading to this
release) but went back to a stable version, be careful when upgrading
to this version.  In particular, you will probably want to remove the
@file{~/News/marks} directory (perhaps selectively), so that flags are
read from your @file{~/.newsrc.eld} instead of from the stale marks
file, where this release will store flags for nntp.  See a later entry
for more information about nntp marks.  Note that downgrading isn't
safe in general.

@item The nntp back end store article marks in @file{~/News/marks}.

The directory can be changed using the (customizable) variable
@code{nntp-marks-directory}, and marks can be disabled using the
(backend) variable @code{nntp-marks-is-evil}.  The advantage of this
is that you can copy @file{~/News/marks} (using rsync, scp or
whatever) to another Gnus installation, and it will realize what
articles you have read and marked.  The data in @file{~/News/marks}
has priority over the same data in @file{~/.newsrc.eld}.

@item
Picons can be displayed right from the textual address, see
@code{gnus-picon-style}

@item
You can import and export your @acronym{RSS} subscriptions from
@acronym{OPML} files.  @xref{RSS}.

@item
The option @code{mm-fill-flowed} can be used to disable treatment of
format=flowed messages.  Also, flowed text is disabled when sending
inline @acronym{PGP} signed messages.

@item You can now drag and drop attachments to the Message buffer.

@item @kbd{/ r} limits the summary buffer to replied articles.

@item @acronym{ANSI} @acronym{SGR} control sequences can be transformed
using @kbd{W A}.

@acronym{ANSI} sequences are used in some Chinese hierarchies for
highlighting articles (@code{gnus-article-treat-ansi-sequences}).

@item Gnus includes an Emacs Lisp @acronym{SASL} library.

This provide a clean @acronym{API} to @acronym{SASL} mechanisms from
within Emacs.  The user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier
situation, include support for @acronym{DIGEST}-@acronym{MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}.

@item ManageSieve connections uses the @acronym{SASL} library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for @acronym{DIGEST-MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}, when the server support it.

@item Gnus include a password cache mechanism in password.el.

It is enabled by default (see @code{password-cache}), with a short
timeout of 16 seconds (see @code{password-cache-expiry}).  If
@acronym{PGG} is used as the @acronym{PGP} backend, the @acronym{PGP}
passphrase is managed by this mechanism.  Passwords for ManageSieve
connections are managed by this mechanism, after quering the user about
whether to do so.

@item @acronym{IMAP} identity (@acronym{RFC} 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus do not send any information about itself, but you can
customize it using the variable @code{nnimap-id}.

@item The @file{all.SCORE} file can be edited from the group buffer
using @kbd{W e}.

@item Gnus now MIME decode articles even when they lack "MIME-Version" header.
This changes the default of @code{gnus-article-loose-mime}.

latest version of gnus or some explanation on where to find it.

A way to continue editing the latest Message composition.

gnus-kill is much slower than it was in GNUS 4.1.3.

Bugs:

* when expunging articles on low score, the sparse nodes keep hanging on?
* starting the first time seems to hang Gnus on some systems.  Does
NEWGROUPS answer too fast?
* nndir doesn't read gzipped files.
* FAQ doesn't have an up node?
* when moving mail from a procmail spool to the crash-box,
the crash-box is only appropriate to one specific group.
* `t' `t' makes X-Faces disappear.
* nnmh-be-safe means that crossposted articles will
be marked as unread.
* Orphan score entries dont show on "V t" score trace
* when clearing out data, the cache data should also be reset.
* rewrite gnus-summary-limit-children to be non-recursive
to avoid exceeding lisp nesting on huge groups.
* expinged articles are counted when computing scores.
* implement gnus-batch-brew-soup
* ticked articles aren't easy to read in pick mode -- `n' and
stuff just skips past them.  Read articles are the same.
* topics that contain just groups with ticked
articles aren't displayed.
* nndoc should always allocate unique Message-IDs.
* implement gnus-score-thread
* If there are mail groups the first time you use Gnus, Gnus'll
make the mail groups killed. 
* no "no news is good news" when using topics.
* when doing crosspost marking, the cache has to be consulted
and articles have to be removed.
* nnweb should fetch complete articles when they are split into several
parts.
* scoring on head immediate doesn't work.
* finding short score file names takes forever.
* canceling articles in foreign groups.
* nntp-open-rlogin no longer works.
* C-u C-x C-s (Summary) switches to the group buffer.
* move nnmail-split-history out to the backends.
* nnweb doesn't work properly.
* using a virtual server name as `gnus-select-method' doesn't work?
* when killing/yanking a group from one topic to another in a slave, the 
master will yank it first to one topic and then add it to another.  
Perhaps.

New features:

* warn user about `=' redirection of a group in the active file?
* really unbinhex binhex files.
* take over the XEmacs menubar and offer a toggle between the XEmacs
bar and the Gnus bar.
* push active file and NOV file parsing down into C code.
`(canonize-message-id id)'
`(mail-parent-message-id references n)'

* when entering groups, get the real number of unread articles from
the server?  
* sort after gathering threads -- make false roots have the
headers of the oldest orhpan with a 0 article number?
* nndoc groups should inherit the score files of their parents?  Also
inherit copy prompts and save files.

* allow editing the group description from the group buffer
for backends that support that.
* gnus-{hide,show}-all-topics

* hide (sub)threads with low score.
* when expiring, remove all marks from expired articles.
* gnus-summary-limit-to-body
* a regexp alist that says what level groups are to be subscribed
on.  Eg. -- `(("nnml:" . 1))'.
* easier interface to nnkiboze to create ephemeral groups that
contaion groups that match a regexp.
* allow newlines in <URL:> urls, but remove them before using
the URL.
* If there is no From line, the mail backends should fudge one from the
"From " line.

from subject lines.

From: John Griffith <griffith@sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de>
* I like the option for trying to retrieve the FAQ for a group and I was
thinking it would be great if for those newsgroups that had archives
you could also try to read the archive for that group.  Part of the
problem is that archives are spread all over the net, unlike FAQs.
What would be best I suppose is to find the one closest to your site.

In any case, there is a list of general news group archives at
ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/users/claird/news.lists/newsgroup_archives.html

* tanken var at når du bruker `gnus-startup-file' som prefix (FOO) til å lete
opp en fil FOO-SERVER, FOO-SERVER.el, FOO-SERVER.eld, kan du la den være en
liste hvor du bruker hvert element i listen som FOO, istedet.  da kunne man
hatt forskjellige serveres startup-filer forskjellige steder.


*LMI> Well, nnbabyl could alter the group info to heed labels like
LMI> answered and read, I guess.  

It could also keep them updated (the same for the Status: header of
unix mbox files).

They could be used like this:

`M l <name> RET' add label <name> to current message.
`M u <name> RET' remove label <name> from current message.
`/ l <expr> RET' limit summary buffer according to <expr>.

<expr> would be a boolean expression on the labels, e.g. 

	`/ l bug & !fixed RET'

would show all the messages which are labeled `bug' but not labeled
`fixed'. 

One could also immagine the labels being used for highliting, or
affect the summary line format.


*Sender: abraham@dina.kvl.dk

I'd like a gnus-find-file which work like find file, except that it
would recognize things that looks like messages or folders:

- If it is a directory containing numbered files, create an nndir
summary buffer.

- For other directories, create a nneething summaru buffer.

- For files matching "\\`From ", create a nndoc/mbox summary.

- For files matching "\\`BABYL OPTIONS:", create a nndoc/baby summary.

- For files matching "\\`[^ \t\n]+:", create an *Article* buffer.

- For other files, just find them normally.

I'd like `nneething' to use this function, so it would work on a
directory potentially containing mboxes or babyl files.

*Please send a mail to bwarsaw@cnri.reston.va.us (Barry A. Warsaw) and
tell him what you are doing.

*Currently, I get prompted:

decend into sci?
- type y
decend into sci.something ?
- type n
decend into ucd?

The problem above is that since there is really only one subsection of
science, shouldn't it prompt you for only decending sci.something?  If
there was a sci.somethingelse group or section, then it should prompt
for sci? first the sci.something? then sci.somethingelse?...

*Ja, det burde være en måte å si slikt.  Kanskje en ny variabel?
`gnus-use-few-score-files'?  Så kunne score-regler legges til den
"mest" lokale score-fila.  F. eks. ville no-gruppene betjenes av
"no.all.SCORE", osv.

*What i want is for Gnus to treat any sequence or combination of the following
as a single spoiler warning and hide it all, replacing it with a "Next Page"
button:
 

	^L's

	more than n blank lines
	
	more than m identical lines 
	(which should be replaced with button to show them)

	any whitespace surrounding any of the above


*Well, we could allow a new value to `gnus-thread-ignore-subject' --
`spaces', or something.  (We could even default to that.)  And then
subjects that differ in white space only could be considered the
"same" subject for threading purposes. 

*Modes to preprocess the contents (e.g. jka-compr) use the second form
"(REGEXP FUNCTION NON-NIL)" while ordinary modes (e.g. tex) use the first
form "(REGEXP . FUNCTION)", so you could use it to distinguish between
those two types of modes. (auto-modes-alist, insert-file-contents-literally.)

* Under XEmacs -- do funny article marks:
tick - thumb tack
killed - skull
soup - bowl of soup
score below - dim light bulb
score over - bright light bulb

*Yes. I think the algorithm is as follows:

Group-mode
	show-list-of-articles-in-group
	if (key-pressed == SPACE) {
		if (no-more-articles-in-group-to-select) {
			if (articles-selected)
				start-reading-selected-articles;
			junk-unread-articles;
			next-group;
		} else {
			show-next-page;
		}
	} else if (key-pressed = '.') {
		if (consolidated-menus)		# same as hide-thread in Gnus
			select-thread-under-cursor;
		else
			select-article-under-cursor;
	}

Article-mode
	if (key-pressed == SPACE) {
		if (more-pages-in-article)
			next-page;
		else if (more-selected-articles-to-read)
			next-article;
		else 
			next-group;
	}

*My precise need here would have been to limit files to Incoming*.
One could think of some `nneething-only-files' variable, but I guess
it would have been unacceptable if one was using many unrelated such
nneething groups.

A more useful approach would be to, in response to the `G D' prompt, be
allowed to say something like: `~/.mail/Incoming*', somewhat limiting
the top-level directory only (in case directories would be matched by
the wildcard expression).

*It would be nice if it also handled 

	<URL:news://sunsite.auc.dk/>

which should correspond to `B nntp RET sunsite.auc.dk' in *Group*.


*
  Take a look at w3-menu.el in the Emacs-W3 distribution - this works out
really well.  Each menu is 'named' by a symbol that would be on a
gnus-*-menus (where * would be whatever, but at least group, summary, and
article versions) variable.

  So for gnus-summary-menus, I would set to '(sort mark dispose ...)

  A value of '1' would just put _all_ the menus in a single 'GNUS' menu in
the main menubar.  This approach works really well for Emacs-W3 and VM.


* nndoc should take care to create unique Message-IDs for all its
articles.
* gnus-score-followup-article only works when you have a summary buffer
active.  Make it work when posting from the group buffer as well.
(message-sent-hook).
* rewrite gnus-demon to use run-with-idle-timers.

* * Enhancements to Gnus:

  Add two commands:

  * gnus-servers (gnus-start-server-buffer?)--enters Gnus and goes
    straight to the server buffer, without opening any connections to
    servers first.

  * gnus-server-read-server-newsrc--produces a buffer very similar to
    the group buffer, but with only groups from that server listed;
    quitting this buffer returns to the server buffer.

* add a command to check the integrity of an nnfolder folder --
go through the article numbers and see that there are no duplicates,
and stuff.

* `unsmileyfy-buffer' to undo smileification.

* a command to give all relevant info on an article, including all
secondary marks.

* when doing `-request-accept-article', the backends should do
the nnmail duplicate checking.

* allow `message-signature-file' to be a function to return the
value of the signature file.

* In addition, I would love it if I could configure message-tab so that it
could call `bbdb-complete-name' in other headers.  So, some sort of
interface like

(setq message-tab-alist
      '((message-header-regexp message-expand-group)
        ("^\\(To\\|[cC]c\\|[bB]cc\\)"  bbdb-complete-name)))

then you could run the relevant function to complete the information in
the header

* cache the newsgroups file locally to avoid reloading it all the time.

        usage when using a file-based backend (e.g., nnfolder).

	* nnfolder.el (nnfolder-possibly-change-group) Added check on
        modtime of mbox.  This should help those who use procmail.

	* nnfolder.el (nnfolder-always-close) Added this variable to
        determine if nnfolder should got for speed or minimize space
        requirements.  The old tradeoff.  If this new variable is t,
        nnfolder will try and keep only one mbox open at a time.  This
        will cost some time!

	* nnfolder.el (nnfolder-ignore-active-file) Renamed
        nnfolder-active-file--paranoia to something mor reasonable.  Did
        not change the sense.

	* nnmail.el (nnmail-request-move-article,
	nnmail-request-accept-article): Functions for moving articles. One
	can move articles between mail groups that use different select
	methods, which also makes these functions double as conversion

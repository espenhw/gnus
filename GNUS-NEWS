* Changes in No Gnus

** The nntp back end store article marks in `~/News/marks'.

The directory can be changed using the (customizable) variable
`nntp-marks-directory', and marks can be disabled using the (backend)
variable `nntp-marks-is-evil'.  The advantage of this is that you can
copy `~/News/marks' (using rsync, scp or whatever) to another Gnus
installation, and it will realize what articles you have read and
marked.  The data in `~/News/marks' has priority over the same data
in `~/.newsrc.eld'.  This means that if you downgrade to, say, Gnus
5.10 and read mail and later come back to this Gnus version, your
marks will be stale.  You can remove the `~/News/marks' content (even
selectively) to remedy this.

** You can import and export your RSS subscriptions from OPML files.

** The option `mm-fill-flowed' can be used to disable treatment of
format=flowed messages.  Also, flowed text is disabled when sending
inline PGP signed messages.

** You can now drag and drop attachments to the Message buffer.

** `/ r' limits the summary buffer to replied articles.

** ANSI SGR control sequences can be transformed using `W A'.

ANSI sequences are used in some Chinese hierarchies for highlighting
articles (`gnus-article-treat-ansi-sequences').

** Gnus includes an Emacs Lisp SASL library.

This provide a clean API to SASL mechanisms from within Emacs.  The
user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier situation,
include support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM.

** ManageSieve connections uses the SASL library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM,
when the server support it.

** Gnus include a password cache mechanism in password.el.

It is enabled by default (see `password-cache'), with a short timeout
of 16 seconds (see `password-cache-expiry').  If PGG is used as the
PGP backend, the PGP passphrase is managed by this mechanism.
Passwords for ManageSieve connections are managed by this mechanism,
after quering the user about whether to do so.

** IMAP identity (RFC 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus do not send any information about itself, but you can
customize it using the variable `nnimap-id'.

** The `all.SCORE' file can be edited from the group buffer using `W e'.

** Gnus now MIME decode articles even when they lack "MIME-Version"
header.  This changes the default of `gnus-article-loose-mime'.
